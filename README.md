For the moment this works only for CapitalOne data, I will add to this shortly. I have also removed data from the dictionaries.py file so as to not give away personal information, I have left some information as an example but you will need to rebuild them.

If you would like to use this script in Jupyter Notebook change and run the below code below before you run the Budget program.

import os

os.getcwd()

os.chdir('/path/to/folder/containing/budget_config/')
